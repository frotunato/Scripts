Scripts
=======
Do not run any script as root (including sudo) user. It will cause problems with 'screen' sessions.

Megatools utility is required to run megaBackup.sh (all credits for http://megatools.megous.com).

Also, in order to run fullBackupEnhanced.sh and restoreLastBackup.sh you need the LZ4 tool installed in your system. 

The point of using this algorithm is to reduce as much as possible the CPU usage mantaining a great filesize(~65% compress 
ratio with lz4 default options), and an incredibly fast decompression speed. 

This is the directory tree that you should have in your /home/user directory:

|-home
 |-user
  |---storage
  |-----ramdisk
  |-------world
  |-------world_nether
  |-------world_the_end
  |-----backup
  |-------***.tar.lz4     #a bunch of backups
  |---minecraft
  |-------other stuff
  |-------world           #symbolic link to home/user/ramdisk/world
  |-------world_nether    #symbolic link to home/user/ramdisk/world_the_end
  |-------world_the_end   #symbolic link to home/user/ramdisk/world_nether
  |---ramdisk
  |-----world
  |-----world_nether
  |-----world_the_end
