Scripts
=======
Do not run the scripts as root (including sudo) user. It will cause problems with 'screen' sessions.
This is the directory tree that you must have in your /home/user directory:
|-home
 |-user
  |---storage
  |-----ramdisk
  |-------world
  |-------world_nether
  |-------world_the_end
  |-----backup
  |---minecraft
  |-------other stuff
  |-------world           #symbolic link to home/user/ramdisk/world
  |-------world_nether    #symbolic link to home/user/ramdisk/world_the_end
  |-------world_the_end   #symbolic link to home/user/ramdisk/world_nether
  |---ramdisk
  |-----world
  |-----world_nether
  |-----world_the_end
