Scripts
=======
Do not run the script as root (including sudo) user. It will cause problems with 'screen' sessions.

Megatools utility (http://megatools.megous.com) and LZ4 tool are needed to run the script.

The point of using the LZ4 algorithm is to reduce as much as possible the CPU usage mantaining a great filesize (~65% compress ratio with lz4 default options), and an incredibly fast decompression speed. 

This is the directory tree that you should have in your /home/user directory:

|-home
 |-user
  |---storage
  |-----$RAMDISK_MIRROR
  |-------world
  |-------world_nether
  |-------world_the_end
  |-----$BACKUP_PATH
  |-------***.tar.lz4     #a bunch of backups
  |---$SERVER_PATH
  |-------other stuff
  |-------world           #symbolic link to $RAMDISK/world
  |-------world_nether    #symbolic link to $RAMDISK/world_the_end
  |-------world_the_end   #symbolic link to $RAMDISK/world_nether
  |---$RAMDISK
  |-----world
  |-----world_nether
  |-----world_the_end
